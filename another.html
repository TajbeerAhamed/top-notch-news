              <strong>ans:In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are var, let, and const. Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var keyword is the global or function scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function.  The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can’t be accessible outside the particular block.The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword, except the user cannot update it.When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise, it returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared.

                Difference between arrow function and regular function?

                ans: The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and regular functions is their syntax.Inside a
                regular function, execution context is dynamic. This means that the value of this depends on how the function was
                invoked . On the other hand, an arrow function does not define its own execution context. This results in an arrow
                function's this being resolved lexically .Arrow functions  a new feature introduced in ES6  enable writing concise functions in JavaScript. While both regular and arrow functions work in a similar manner, yet there are certain interesting differences between them, as discussed below.Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are ‘constructible’ and ‘callable’. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the ‘new’ keyword. However, the arrow functions are only ‘callable’ and not constructible. Thus, we will get a run-time error on trying to construct a non-constructible arrow functions using the new keyword.

                ans:Template literals (template strings) allow you to use strings or embedded expressions in the form of a string.Template literals are enclosed by backtick (`) characters instead of double or single quotes.Along with having
                normal strings, template literals can also contain other parts called placeholders, which are embedded expressions
                delimited by a dollar sign and curly braces: ${expression}. The strings and placeholders get passed to a function —
                either a default function, or a function you supply. The default function (when you don't supply your own) just
                performs
                string interpolation to do substitution of the placeholders and then concatenate the parts into a single string.
