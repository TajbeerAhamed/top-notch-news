    <h2>Q.1 Differences of var, let and const ?</h2>

<h4>ans:var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
    var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared;
    const
    variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
    They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and
    const
    variables are not initialized.</h4>

<h2>Q.2 Difference between arrow function and regular function?</h2>

<h4>ans: The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and regular functions is their syntax.Inside a
    regular function, execution context is dynamic. This means that the value of this depends on how the function was
    invoked . On the other hand, an arrow function does not define its own execution context. This results in an arrow
    function's this being resolved lexically .</h4>

<h2>Q.3 Why we use template string ?</h2>

<h4>ans:Template literals are enclosed by backtick (`) characters instead of double or single quotes.Along with having
    normal strings, template literals can also contain other parts called placeholders, which are embedded expressions
    delimited by a dollar sign and curly braces: ${expression}. The strings and placeholders get passed to a function â€”
    either a default function, or a function you supply. The default function (when you don't supply your own) just
    performs
    string interpolation to do substitution of the placeholders and then concatenate the parts into a single string.
